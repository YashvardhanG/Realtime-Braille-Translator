# Realtime-Braille-Translator

Real-Time Braille Translator is a hardware project to convert English to Braille in real-time. The aim of this project is to create a low-cost and efficient method to convert English to Braille and make it easier for visually-impaired people to read various things such as books, newspapers, etc.

This project creates a prototype device using Arduino and Linear Solenoid Actuators. This converts one letter at a time, and has currently has limited functionality. In the future, it is aimed to provide the functionality to read text using OCR methods and convert in braille in real-time.
